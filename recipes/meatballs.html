        <p>I never knew how to make good meatballs until I found this recipe. 
            I normally make mine with just ground beef and they still taste great.
            I've used the combination of pork, beef and veal and they are equally good.
            Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese instead of using the canned variety...
            it really does make a difference.
