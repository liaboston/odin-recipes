        <p><h2> Description </h2></p>

        <p>One of the best known and frequently requested desserts, panna cotta -
            literally “cooked cream” - originated in Piedmont and is made of cream and sugar.
            There are different versions and flavorings. Its delicate sweetness, smooth
            texture and the elegant way it is plated make it a perfect treat at the end of a meal.

                            <li><p> Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until 
                                combined. Set aside.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and
                                bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.  
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>Immediately stir gelatin mixture into boiling cream, stirring until completely 
                                dissolved. Cook and stir for 1 minute. 
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p> Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla. </p></li>
                            <li><p>Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until 
                                no longer warm, about 20 minutes.

                            <li>When cool, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours but 
                                preferably overnight. 
                            </li>
