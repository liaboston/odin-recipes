        <p><strong> Description </strong></p>
        <p><em>Spaghetti aglio e olio</em> translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.”
            The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients.
            It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes,
            but even these are optional.In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features 
            spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.
        </p>
        <p> But if you have ever tried it, you know that <em>spaghetti aglio e olio</em> is far more 
            than the sum of its parts. The garlic infuses the oil with rich, nutty flavor, 
            and salty, starchy pasta cooking water transforms it into a deeply flavorful
            sauce. Add perfect al dente pasta to the mix, and it is absolute heaven.
