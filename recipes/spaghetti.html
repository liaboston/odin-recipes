        <h1>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</h1>

        <p><h2> Description </h2></p>
            <p class="description"><em>Spaghetti aglio e olio</em> translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.”
            The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients.
            It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes,
            but even these are optional.In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features 
            spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.
        </p>

        <p class="description"> But if you have ever tried it, you know that <em>spaghetti aglio e olio</em> is far more 
            than the sum of its parts. The garlic infuses the oil with rich, nutty flavor, 
            and salty, starchy pasta cooking water transforms it into a deeply flavorful
            sauce. Add perfect al dente pasta to the mix, and it is absolute heaven.

            <p><h2> Ingredients </h2></p>

            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, thiny sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon red papper flakes, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black papper to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
                <li>1 cup finely ground Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
             
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling 
                        water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 
                        minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. 
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly
                        toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil 
                        begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 
                        minutes. Remove from heat. 
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and
                        garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano 
                        cheese; stir until combined. 
                    </p></li>

                    <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
